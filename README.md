## What is a JOLCO?

A **JOLCO (Japanese Operating Lease with Call Option)** is a structured ship finance product in which:

1. A **Japanese SPC** (Special Purpose Company) acquires a vessel.
2. The SPC is funded by:
   - **~70% JPY bank debt** from a Japanese regional bank or trust bank at low JPY rates (TONA/TIBOR + spread), hedged into USD via a cross currency basis swap.
   - **~30% TK equity** from Japanese individual or institutional investors through a **Tokumei Kumiai (匿名組合)**, a silent partnership under Japan's Commercial Code that passes tax losses directly to investors.
3. The SPC **bareboat charters** the vessel back to the original seller / shipping company under a long term BBC.
4. The **BBC hire** has two components:
   - **Scheduled Amortization Component (Fixed hire)** = Vessel Price divided by Amortization Period. Covers principal repayment. Rate insensitive and does not move with SOFR or JPY rates.
   - **Financing Return Component (Variable hire)** = All in rate multiplied by outstanding balance. Covers interest on both the bank loan and the equity portion. Tied to reference rates: the bank portion moves with the JPY base rate plus swap cost, and the equity portion moves with SOFR.
5. The charterer holds **Purchase Options** stepping down over the lease term. The final year is an **obligation** to buy.
6. **Depreciation** on the full vessel cost flows through the TK to investors, creating paper losses that offset their other taxable Japanese income. This is the primary economic driver (Stream ②).

**All percentages and rates are fully user adjustable.** The defaults are a realistic base case only.

## The Three Return Streams

| Stream | What it is | Driver |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **① Charter Hire Spread** | Equity return embedded in charter hire, net of brokerage, allocated to TK investors. Represents the interest earned on the equity portion of the outstanding balance. | Equity rate (SOFR + spread) minus BBC brokerage |
| **② Tax Shield** | Tax saved when SPC depreciation losses flow via TK to investors, offsetting their other Japanese taxable income | MOF depreciation schedule multiplied by effective JP tax rate |
| **③ Residual / PO** | Net proceeds when charterer exercises the Purchase Option, minus remaining bank debt and capital gains tax | PO price vs book value vs outstanding debt |

The **Blended IRR** is the Internal Rate of Return combining all three streams against the total equity plus sale commission outflow at Year 0.

## Financing Structure — JPY Bank Loan

The SPC borrows in JPY from a Japanese bank. Since BBC hire is paid in USD, the SPC executes a **cross currency basis swap** to convert its JPY obligations into USD cashflows. Realistic market parameters:

| Parameter | Typical range | Default in this model |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| JPY base rate (TONA/TIBOR) | 0.05 to 0.75% | 0.50% |
| Bank spread over JPY base | 80 to 130 bps | 100 bps |
| USD/JPY cross currency swap cost | 20 to 45 bps | 35 bps |
| **Effective USD cost of bank debt** | **~1.5 to 2.5%** | **~1.85%** |
| Equity rate (SOFR + spread) | SOFR + 200 to 350 bps | SOFR 4.3% + 280 bps = **7.1%** |

The sharp difference between cheap JPY bank debt (~1.85%) and the USD equity rate (~7.1%) is a core economic lever. The bank earns very little while equity captures the spread.

## Commissions

Two separate brokerage commissions are modelled:

| Commission | Default | When paid | Tax treatment |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Sale Commission** | 2.0% of VP | Year 0, at closing | Upfront cost. Increases total equity deployed |
| **BBC Commission** | 1.25% of gross hire | Annual, each year | Deductible SPC expense. Reduces taxable P&L and equity net cashflow |

## Tax and Depreciation (Japanese Rules)

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Corporation Tax | 23.2% standard rate |
| Local business tax | ~4.2% |
| Defense surtax | ~3.2% |
| **Effective rate default** | **30.62%** (fully adjustable) |
| Depreciation method | 200% Declining Balance switching to Straight Line when SL is greater than or equal to DB (post FY2012 MOF ordinance) |
| Special depreciation | 18 to 32% of cost in Year 1 for MLIT certified advanced **newbuildings** only |
| Foreign flag vessels | 12 year flat useful life (MOF 耐用年数省令 Beppyō 1, その他のもの) |
| Japanese flag vessels | Type specific: 11 to 15 years per MOF schedule |
| LPG carriers | Use oil tanker useful life per NTA Circular 2-4-2 |

---

## Second-Hand Vessel Provisions

When the vessel age at delivery is greater than zero, the model automatically applies the Japanese NTA rules for used assets under **MOF Ordinance Article 3 (耐用年数省令 第3条)**.

### Remaining Useful Life Formula (中古資産の耐用年数)

| Condition | Remaining Life |
|-----------|---------------|
| Age ≥ statutory new life | `max(2, floor(newLife × 0.2))` |
| Age < statutory new life | `max(2, floor((newLife − age) + age × 0.2))` |

The second formula simplifies to `max(2, floor(newLife − age × 0.8))`. A minimum of 2 years is always applied regardless of how old the vessel is.

**Example — 8-year-old Bulk Carrier ≥2,000 GT (foreign flag, newLife = 12 yr):**
- `max(2, floor((12 − 8) + 8 × 0.2)) = max(2, floor(4 + 1.6)) = max(2, 5) = 5 yr`

### Key Differences for Second-Hand vs Newbuilding

| Item | Newbuilding | Second-Hand |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Useful life | Full statutory (9–15 yr) | Remaining NTA life (min 2 yr) |
| Depreciation schedule | Runs for full new life | Runs only for remaining life |
| Year 1 DB rate | 2 / newLife | 2 / remainingLife (higher — faster write-off) |
| Special depreciation (MLIT) | Eligible (18–32%) | Generally **not eligible** — applies to certified new advanced vessels only. Verify with tax counsel |
| Debt LTV | Banks typically 70% | Banks typically 60–65% for older vessels — adjust `debtPct` accordingly |
| Construction period | Usually 1–2 yr pre-delivery | Immediate delivery — no construction lag |

### What the calculator does automatically

1. Reads vessel type and flag to determine statutory new life per MOF Beppyō 1.
2. Applies the NTA Art. 3 formula to derive remaining useful life from the entered vessel age.
3. Runs the full 200% DB → SL depreciation schedule on the **remaining life**, starting from the full **purchase price** (not original cost — the TK SPC acquires at current market price).
4. Displays the remaining vs new life in both Tab 1 (Vessel & Structure) and Tab 2 (Depreciation Scale).
5. Warns if special depreciation is set above zero for a second-hand vessel.
6. The MOF Rate Index in Tab 2 shows the NTA-computed remaining life for every vessel type at the entered age.

### Financial model per year (useMemo)

```
CASH IN TO SPC:
  Sched. Amort. Component (Fixed hire)  = VP / amortYrs                      (rate insensitive)
  Financing Return Component (Variable) = outstandingDebt   × bankAllInRate  (JPY bank interest, hedged USD)
                                        + outstandingEquity × equityAllInRate (equity return component)
  BBC Commission   = totalHire × bbcCommission%                 (deducted, reduces SPC P&L)
  Net hire         = totalHire − bbcCommCost

CASH OUT TO BANK (always senior):
  bankPrincipal    = annualPrincipal × debtPct%
  bankInterest     = outstandingDebt × bankAllInRate

NET TO EQUITY:
  equityPrincipal  = annualPrincipal × equityPct%              (return OF capital)
  hireSpread       = outstandingEquity × equityAllInRate        (equity return in hire, Stream ①, net of brokerage)
  netCF            = equityPrincipal + hireSpread − bbcCommCost + taxShield + residual

SPC TAXABLE P&L:
  = netHire − depreciation − bankInterest
  taxShield        = −spcTaxablePL × taxRate%                  (Stream ②: positive = tax saved)

RESIDUAL (exit year only):
  grossResidual    = poPriceMil − remainingDebt
  capGainTax       = max(0, poPriceMil − bookValue) × taxRate%
  residualToEquity = grossResidual − capGainTax                 (Stream ③)

YEAR 0:
  equityCF[0]      = −(equity + saleCommCost)
  bankAllInRate    = (jpyBaseRate + bankSpreadBps/100)/100 + swapCostBps/10000
  equityAllInRate  = (sofrRate + spreadBps/100)/100
```
